# Task Tracker Template

This file is a template/reference for task tracking behavior.

Live tracking must happen in `<project-root>/docs/plans/task.md`.

The live task file should contain only task list rows (no instructions or prose).

| id | task | status | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| example-1 | Read applicable skill and restate scope | pending | |
| example-2 | Implement scoped changes | pending | |
| example-3 | Run verification commands | pending | |
| example-4 | Report evidence and finalize | pending | |
